Demo project for the AWEsome framework, a Cloud Automation Tool.

The final idea is divided in 3 parts:

1) creating a story parser, using NLP;
2) creating a generator API (to be used by the plugins);
3) creating a generator Implementation, for Maven + Java + JSF + JPA.

So far, I am creating a very simple (could be useful, though) demo for the project. I am starting from the Generator,
and will move later on to the Parser (a bit more complicated).

For this demo, I will use FreeMarker to generate the Beans and Views. I am starting with a HelloWorld example, and will
slowly make more complicated projects that the generator has to be able to create.
